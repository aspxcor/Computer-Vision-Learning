# Computer-Vision-Learning
Some Projects About Computer Vision to Help us Learn Computer Vision Better

Hw1~Hw3 are the homework iin the ZJU Computer Vision class. To be continued...

## Homework 1. Make a silent short video by using OpenCV
### Program description

> 1. Program to generate a new video meeting the following requirements. The generated video will be automatically saved in a video file with a specified file name after the program runs;
> 2. Content 1: At the beginning, it was a title, with lens switching, and showing related photos of Zhejiang University and personal photos. Show your student ID and name and other information.
> 3. Content 2: After the camera is switched, slowly draw a very simple children's drawing. The content of children's drawings is self-designed and written in the program. Cannot read a painted picture.
> 4. Other content: freely design by yourself
> 5. Content N: Programming an ending animation
> 6. Programming to achieve all lens switching effects;
> 7. There is a certain storyline, free design
> 8. Click the space to pause the video, and click again to continue.

## Homework 2. Contour/line extraction

### Program description

> 1. The core function of the detection algorithm needs to be implemented by writing own code. You cannot call opencv or other functions related to circular line detection in the SDK. If you want to use edge detection, this can be adjusted Use opencv function.
> 2. Display the final test results on the original image;
> 3. Show some key intermediate results separately
> 4. Debugging results of three specified test images (coin, seal and highway) must be carried out. In addition, you can voluntarily add some test images

## Homework 3. Harris Corner Detected

### Program description

> 1. You need to write your own code to implement the Harris Corner detection algorithm, and you cannot directly call the functions related to Harris corner detection in OpenCV;
> 2. Display the intermediate processing results and the final detection results, including the maximum eigenvalue map and the minimum eigenvalue map R map (you can consider color display to superimpose the detection results on the original image, etc., and output these intermediate results as image files.
