# # Homework 1 Name: Make a silent short video by using OpenCV
# # Program description:
    # 1. Program to generate a new video meeting the following requirements. The generated video will be automatically saved in a video file with a specified file name after the program runs;
    # 2. Content 1: At the beginning, it was a title, with lens switching, and showing related photos of Zhejiang University and personal photos. Show your student ID and name and other information.
    # 3. Content 2: After the camera is switched, slowly draw a very simple children's drawing. The content of children's drawings is self-designed and written in the program. Cannot read a painted picture.
    # 4. Other content: freely design by yourself.
    # 5. Content N: Programming an ending animation
    # 6. Programming to achieve all lens switching effects;
    # 7. There is a certain storyline, free design
    # 8. Click the space to pause the video, and click again to continue.
